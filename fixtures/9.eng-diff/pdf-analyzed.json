In the event the Corporation shall declare a distribution payable in securities of other Persons, evidences of\nindebtedness issuedby the Corporation or other Persons, assets (excluding cash dividends) or options or rights not referred to in this Section B.2 to the holders\nof Common Stock, then, in each such case for the purpose of this Section B.2, the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to a proportionate\nshare of any such distribution as though they were the holders of the number of shares of Common Stock of the Corporation into which such shares of Series\nA Preferred Stock are convertible as of the record date fixed for the determination of the holders of Common Stock of the Corporation entitled to receive\nsuch distribution.\n(ii) Recapitalization. If at any time or from time to time there shall be a recapitalization of the Common Stock (other than a subdivision,\ncombination ormerger or sale of assets transaction provided for elsewhere in this Section B.2), provision shall be made so that the holders of the Series A\nPreferred Stock shall thereafter be entitled to receive upon conversion of their Series A Preferred Stock the number of shares of stock or other securities or\nproperty of the Corporation or otherwise, to which a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock deliverable upon conversion would have been entitled\non such recapitalization. In any such case, appropriate adjustment shall be made in the application of the provisions of this Section B.2 with respect to the\nrights of the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock after the recapitalization to the end that the provisions of this Section B.2 (including adjustment of the\napplicable Series A Conversion Price for the Series A Preferred Stock then in effect and the number of shares issuable upon conversion of the Series A\nPreferred Stock) shall be applicable after that event as nearly equivalent as may be practicable.\n(iii) No Impairment. The Corporation will not, by amendment of its Certificate or through any reorganization, recapitalization, transfer\nof assets, consolidation, merger, dissolution, issue or sale of securities or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance\nof any of the terms to be observed or performed hereunder by the Corporation, but will at all times in good faith assist in the carrying out of all the provisions\nof this Section B.2 and in the taking of all such action as may be reasonably necessary or appropriate in order to protect the conversion rights of the holders\nof the Series A Preferred Stock against impairment.\n(iv) Reorganization. If any capital reorganization or reclassification of the capital stock of the Corporation, or consolidation or merger\nof the Corporationwith and into another corporation shall be effected while any shares of Preferred Stock are outstanding in such a manner that holders of\nshares of Common Stock shall be entitled to receive stock, securities or assets with respect to or in exchange for Common Stock, then, as a condition of such\nreorganization or reclassification, consolidation or merger, lawful and adequate provision shall be made whereby each holder of Series A Preferred Stock\nshall thereafter have the right to receive upon the basis and upon the terms and conditions specified herein and in lieu of the shares of Common Stock\nimmediately theretofore receivable upon conversion of Series A Preferred Stock, such shares of stock, securities or assets as may be issued or payable with\nrespect to or in exchange for a number of outstanding shares of such Common Stock equal to the number of shares of such Common Stock immediately\ntheretofore so receivable had such reorganization or reclassification, consolidation, merger or sale not taken place, and in such case appropriate provision\nshall be made with respect to the rights and interests of the holders of Series A Preferred Stock to the end that the provisions hereof (including, without\nlimitation, provisions for adjustment of the Series A Conversion Price and of the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion thereof) shall\nthereafter be applicable, as nearly as may be reasonably possible, in relation to any shares of stock, securities or assets thereafter deliverable upon the\nconversion of such shares of Series A Preferred Stock.
