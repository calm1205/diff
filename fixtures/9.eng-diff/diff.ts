Other Provisions regarding Optional Conversion.
No fractional shares shall be issued upon the conversion of any shares of Series A Preferred Stock. All shares of Common Stock
(including fractionsthereof) issuable upon conversion of more than one share of Series A Preferred Stock by a holder thereof shall be aggregated
for purposes of determining whether conversion would result in the issuance of any fractional share. If, after the aforementioned aggregation, the
conversion would result in the issuance of a fraction of a share of Common Stock, the Corporation shall, in lieu of issuing any fractional share, pay
the holder otherwise entitled to such fraction a sum in cash equal to the Fair Market Value of such fraction on the date of conversion (as
determined in good faith by the Board).
An Optional Conversion may be effected by surrender to the Corporation at the principal office of the Corporation of the
certificate for the series ofSeries A Preferred Stock to be converted accompanied by a written notice from the holder stating that such holder elects
to convert all or a specified number of such shares (which may be fractional shares) in accordance with the provisions of this Section B.2(d) and
specifying the name or names in which such holder wishes the certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock to be issued.
In case the written notice specifying the name or names in which a holder of shares of Series A Preferred Stock converted in
accordance with thisSection B.2(d) wishes the certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock to be issued shall specify a name or names
other than that of such holder, such notice shall be accompanied by payment of all transfer taxes payable upon the issuance of shares of Common
Stock in such name or names. As promptly as practicable, and in any event within five (5) Business Days after the surrender of such certificate or
certificates and the receipt of such notice relating thereto and, if applicable, payment of all transfer taxes (or the demonstration to the satisfaction
of the Corporation that such taxes have been paid), the Corporation shall deliver or cause to be delivered (x) certificates representing the number
of validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable full shares of Common Stock to which the holder of shares of Series A Preferred Stock being
converted shall be entitled, and (y) if less than the full number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock evidenced by the surrendered certificate or
certificates is being converted, a new certificate or certificates, of like tenor, for the number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock evidenced by
such surrendered certificate or certificates less the number of shares thereof being converted.
In the case of an Optional Conversion, such conversion shall be deemed to have been made at the close of business on the date of
giving the written
notice referred to in the first sentence of Section B.2.(d)(ii)(B) above and of such surrender of the certificate or certificates representing the shares of Series
A Preferred Stock to be converted so that the rights of the holder thereof as to the shares being converted shall cease except for the right to receive shares
of Common Stock in accordance herewith, and the Person entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock shall be treated for all purposes as having
become the record holder of such shares of Common Stock at such time.
(iii) Reservation of Common Stock. The Corporation shall at all times reserve, and keep available for issuance upon the conversion of the

conversion of all outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock, and shall take all action required to increase the authorized number of shares of Common
Stock if necessary to permit the conversion of all outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock.

after the Series AOriginal Issue Date, subdivide the Common Stock (or other shares of capital stock convertible into Common Stock), by stock split or
otherwise, or combine the Common Stock, or issue additional shares of Common Stock (or other shares of capital stock convertible into Common Stock)
in payment of a stock dividend on the Common Stock, the Series A Conversion Price shall forthwith be proportionately decreased in the case of a
subdivision or stock dividend, or proportionately increased in the case of a combination, with the effect that the Series A Conversion Ratio shall forthwith
be proportionately increased in the case of a subdivision or stock dividend, or proportionately decreased in the case of a combination.
Full Ratchet Protection. If at any time after the date of filing of these Articles (x) the Corporation shall issue shares of Common
Stock (or other sharesof capital stock convertible into Common Stock), and (y) the consideration per share payable to the Corporation for the Common

million, then in each such case (subject to Section B.2(e)(iv)), the Series A Conversion Price, shall be reduced to the lowest price per share at which any
such share of Common Stock (or other share of capital stock convertible into Common Stock) has been so issued or sold.
(iii) Adjustments Only After Stock Issued; Determination of Consideration.

Corporation shall not requirean adjustment hereunder until such securities are exercised or converted into Common Stock capital stock of the Corporation
(or capital stock convertible into Common Stock of the Corporation).

convertible intoCommon Stock shall mean the aggregate of the consideration received for the issuance of such capital stock, plus the consideration that

indebtedness issuedby the Corporation or other Persons, assets (excluding cash dividends) or options or rights not referred to in this Section B.2 to the
holders of Common Stock, then, in each such case for the purpose of this Section B.2, the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to a
proportionate share of any such distribution as though they were the holders of the number of shares of Common Stock of the Corporation into which such
shares of Series A Preferred Stock are convertible as of the record date fixed for the determination of the holders of Common Stock of the Corporation
entitled to receive such distribution.
Recapitalization. If at any time or from time to time there shall be a recapitalization of the Common Stock (other than a
subdivision, combination ormerger or sale of assets transaction provided for elsewhere in this Section B.2), provision shall be made so that the holders of
the Series A Preferred Stock shall thereafter be entitled to receive upon conversion of their Series A Preferred Stock the number of shares of stock or other
securities or property of the Corporation or otherwise, to which a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock deliverable upon conversion would
have been entitled on such recapitalization. In any such case, appropriate adjustment shall be made in the application of the provisions of this Section B.2
with respect to the rights of the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock after the recapitalization to the end that the provisions of this Section B.2 (including
adjustment of the applicable Series A Conversion Price for the Series A Preferred Stock then in effect and the number of shares issuable upon conversion
of the Series A Preferred Stock) shall be applicable after that event as nearly equivalent as may be practicable.

of assets, consolidation, merger, dissolution, issue or sale of securities or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance

provisions of this Section B.2 and in the taking of all such action as may be reasonably necessary or appropriate in order to protect the conversion rights of
the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock against impairment.

of the Corporationwith and into another corporation shall be effected while any shares of Preferred Stock are outstanding in such a manner that holders of
shares of Common Stock shall be entitled to receive stock, securities or assets with respect to or in exchange for Common Stock, then, as a condition of
such reorganization or reclassification, consolidation or merger, lawful and adequate provision shall be made whereby each holder of Series A Preferred
Stock shall thereafter have the right to receive upon the basis and upon the terms and conditions specified herein and in lieu of the shares of Common
Stock immediately theretofore receivable upon conversion of Series A Preferred Stock, such shares of stock, securities or assets as may be issued or
payable with respect to or in exchange for a number of outstanding shares of such Common Stock equal to the number of shares of such Common Stock
immediately theretofore so receivable had such reorganization or reclassification, consolidation, merger or sale not taken place, and in such case
appropriate provision shall be made with respect to the rights and interests of the holders of Series A Preferred Stock to the end that the provisions hereof

conversion thereof) shall thereafter be applicable, as nearly as may be reasonably possible, in relation to any shares of stock, securities or assets thereafter

merger of the Corporation, the survivor or successor corporation (if other than the Corporation) resulting from such consolidation or merger shall assume

(A) such adjustment and readjustment, (B) Series A Conversion at the time in effect, and (C) the number of shares of Common Stock and the amount, if
any, of other property which at the time would be received upon the conversion of a share of Series A Preferred Stock held by such holders.
