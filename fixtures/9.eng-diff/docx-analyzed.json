On any matter presented to the stockholders of the Corporation for their action or consideration at any meeting of\nstockholders of the Corporation (or by written consent of stockholders in lieu of meeting), each holder of outstanding shares of Series A Preferred\nStock shall be entitled to cast the number of votes equal to the number of whole shares of Common Stock into which the shares of Series A\nPreferred Stock held by such holder are convertible as of the record date for determining stockholders entitled to vote on such matter. Except as\nprovided by law or by the other provisions of this Certificate, holders of each series of Series A Preferred Stock shall vote together with the\nholders of Common Stock as a single class. Holders of Series A Preferred Stock are not entitled to cumulative voting.\n(ii) Consent for Certain Amendments. The Corporation shall not amend or modify the Certificate of Incorporation in a manner that\nmaterially andadversely affects the terms, powers, preferences or special rights of the Series A Preferred Stock, except with the affirmative vote or\nconsent of the Series A Majority. In addition, no such amendment or modification may, without the consent of each holder of Series A Preferred\nStock affected thereby, (x) adversely affect any of the conversion features of such series; or (y) reduce the percentage of outstanding shares of such\nseries necessary to modify or amend the terms thereof or to grant waivers thereof.\n(b) Dividends. From and after the date of the issuance of any shares of Series A Preferred Stock, dividends at the rate per annum of\n$50.00 per share shallaccrue on such shares of Series A Preferred Stock (subject to appropriate adjustment in the event of any stock dividend,\nstock split, combination or other similar recapitalization with respect to the Series A Preferred Stock) (the \"Accruing Dividends\"). Accruing\nDividends shall accrue from day to day, whether or not declared, and shall be cumulative. Provided, that there are funds lawfully available\ntherefor, Accruing Dividends shall be paid on the first anniversary of the Series A Original Issue Date and every three months thereafter.

Each outstanding share of Series A Preferred Stock shall be convertible at any time, at the option of the\nholder thereof, into anumber of fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock as is determined by dividing the Series A Original Issue\n1\nPrice by the Series A Conversion Price for such series as in effect at the time of conversion (each, an \"Optional Conversion\"). The Series A\nConversion Price and the Series A Conversion Ratio are subject to possible adjustment as provided in subsection (e) below.\n(ii) Other Provisions regarding Optional Conversion.\n(A) No fractional shares shall be issued upon the conversion of any shares of Series A Preferred Stock. All shares of Common Stock\n(including fractionsthereof) issuable upon conversion of more than one share of Series A Preferred Stock by a holder thereof shall be aggregated\nfor purposes of determining whether conversion would result in the issuance of any fractional share. If, after the aforementioned aggregation, the\nconversion would result in the issuance of a fraction of a share of Common Stock, the Corporation shall, in lieu of issuing any fractional share, pay\nthe holder otherwise entitled to such fraction a sum in cash equal to the Fair Market Value of such fraction on the date of conversion (as\ndetermined in good faith by the Board).\n(B) An Optional Conversion may be effected by surrender to the Corporation at the principal office of the Corporation of the\ncertificate for the series ofSeries A Preferred Stock to be converted accompanied by a written notice from the holder stating that such holder elects\nto convert all or a specified number of such shares (which may be fractional shares) in accordance with the provisions of this Section B.2(d) and\nspecifying the name or names in which such holder wishes the certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock to be issued.\n(C) In case the written notice specifying the name or names in which a holder of shares of Series A Preferred Stock converted in\naccordance with thisSection B.2(d) wishes the certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock to be issued shall specify a name or names\nother than that of such holder, such notice shall be accompanied by payment of all transfer taxes payable upon the issuance of shares of Common\nStock in such name or names. As promptly as practicable, and in any event within five (5) Business Days after the surrender of such certificate or\ncertificates and the receipt of such notice relating thereto and, if applicable, payment of all transfer taxes (or the demonstration to the satisfaction\nof the Corporation that such taxes have been paid), the Corporation shall deliver or cause to be delivered (x) certificates representing the number\nof validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable full shares of Common Stock to which the holder of shares of Series A Preferred Stock being\nconverted shall be entitled, and (y) if less than the full number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock evidenced by the surrendered certificate or\ncertificates is being converted, a new certificate or certificates, of like tenor, for the number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock evidenced by\nsuch surrendered certificate or certificates less the number of shares thereof being converted.\n(D) In the case of an Optional Conversion, such conversion shall be deemed to have been made at the close of business on the date of\ngiving the written\nnotice referred to in the first sentence of Section B.2.(d)(ii)(B) above and of such surrender of the certificate or certificates representing the shares of Series\nA Preferred Stock to be converted so that the rights of the holder thereof as to the shares being converted shall cease except for the right to receive shares\nof Common Stock in accordance herewith, and the Person entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock shall be treated for all purposes as having\nbecome the record holder of such shares of Common Stock at such time.\n(iii) Reservation of Common Stock.

If at any time after the date of filing of these Articles (x) the Corporation shall issue shares of Common\nStock (or other sharesof capital stock convertible into Common Stock), and (y) the consideration per share payable to the Corporation for the Common\nStock (or other share of capital stock convertible into Common Stock) reflects a pre-money imputed equity value of the Corporation of less than $5.5\nmillion, then in each such case (subject to Section B.2(e)(iv)), the Series A Conversion Price, shall be reduced to the lowest price per share at which any\nsuch share of Common Stock (or other share of capital stock convertible into Common Stock) has been so issued or sold.\n(iii) Adjustments Only After Stock Issued; Determination of Consideration.\n(A) The mere issuance of options, warrants or other securities (other than capital stock) convertible into capital stock of the\nCorporation shall not requirean adjustment hereunder until such securities are exercised or converted into Common Stock capital stock of the Corporation\n(or capital stock convertible into Common Stock of the Corporation).\n(B) For purposes of Section B.2(e)(ii), the reference to the consideration received by the Corporation for an issuance of capital stock\nconvertible intoCommon Stock shall mean the aggregate of the consideration received for the issuance of such capital stock, plus the consideration that\nwill be payable to the Corporation upon its conversion into Common Stock.\n(iv) Exceptions.

If at any time or from time to time there shall be a recapitalization of the Common Stock (other than a\nsubdivision, combination ormerger or sale of assets transaction provided for elsewhere in this Section B.2), provision shall be made so that the holders of\nthe Series A Preferred Stock shall thereafter be entitled to receive upon conversion of their Series A Preferred Stock the number of shares of stock or other\nsecurities or property of the Corporation or otherwise, to which a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock deliverable upon conversion would\nhave been entitled on such recapitalization. In any such case, appropriate adjustment shall be made in the application of the provisions of this Section B.2\nwith respect to the rights of the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock after the recapitalization to the end that the provisions of this Section B.2 (including\nadjustment of the applicable Series A Conversion Price for the Series A Preferred Stock then in effect and the number of shares issuable upon conversion\nof the Series A Preferred Stock) shall be applicable after that event as nearly equivalent as may be practicable.\n(iii) No Impairment.
