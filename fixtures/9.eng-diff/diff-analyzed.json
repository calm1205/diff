All shares of Common Stock\n(including fractionsthereof) issuable upon conversion of more than one share of Series A Preferred Stock by a holder thereof shall be aggregated\nfor purposes of determining whether conversion would result in the issuance of any fractional share. If, after the aforementioned aggregation, the\nconversion would result in the issuance of a fraction of a share of Common Stock, the Corporation shall, in lieu of issuing any fractional share, pay\nthe holder otherwise entitled to such fraction a sum in cash equal to the Fair Market Value of such fraction on the date of conversion (as\ndetermined in good faith by the Board).\n(B) An Optional Conversion may be effected by surrender to the Corporation at the principal office of the Corporation of the\ncertificate for the series ofSeries A Preferred Stock to be converted accompanied by a written notice from the holder stating that such holder elects\nto convert all or a specified number of such shares (which may be fractional shares) in accordance with the provisions of this Section B.2(d) and\nspecifying the name or names in which such holder wishes the certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock to be issued.\n(C) In case the written notice specifying the name or names in which a holder of shares of Series A Preferred Stock converted in\naccordance with thisSection B.2(d) wishes the certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock to be issued shall specify a name or names\nother than that of such holder, such notice shall be accompanied by payment of all transfer taxes payable upon the issuance of shares of Common\nStock in such name or names.

If at any time or from time to time there shall be a recapitalization of the Common Stock (other than a\nsubdivision, combination ormerger or sale of assets transaction provided for elsewhere in this Section B.2), provision shall be made so that the holders of\nthe Series A Preferred Stock shall thereafter be entitled to receive upon conversion of their Series A Preferred Stock the number of shares of stock or other\nsecurities or property of the Corporation or otherwise, to which a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock deliverable upon conversion would\nhave been entitled on such recapitalization. In any such case, appropriate adjustment shall be made in the application of the provisions of this Section B.2\nwith respect to the rights of the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock after the recapitalization to the end that the provisions of this Section B.2 (including\nadjustment of the applicable Series A Conversion Price for the Series A Preferred Stock then in effect and the number of shares issuable upon conversion\nof the Series A Preferred Stock) shall be applicable after that event as nearly equivalent as may be practicable.\n(iii) No Impairment.
